            What the title says. I wanted to tell this to someone so I don't forget this dream/nightmareâ€¦

            In the dream, for some reason, I needed to make my throat longer, so I embedded a div element in it in order to make some room. This caused some soreness and I started coughing, because the sharp edges of the greater-than-less-than symbols where scratching my skin. I woke up actually coughing and had to drink some water.
